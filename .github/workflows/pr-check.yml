      # Since backend is Node/Express, 'build' might just be linting or checking syntax if no transpile step exists.
      # But common.md says "backend files", usually no build step unless Typescript (but user instruction said "Use ES6+").
      # If there is no build script, we can just install to verify deps.
      # Let's check if there is a build script, otherwise just verify installation.
      # Assuming standard npm install is enough verification for now.
